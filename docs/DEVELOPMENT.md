## Development Workflow

This project follows a spec-driven development methodology with incremental implementation and comprehensive containerized testing at each stage.

### Key Development Principles
- **Container-First Development**: All development, testing, and deployment occurs within Docker containers
- **Parallel Development**: Tasks are structured to allow parallel development of independent services
- **Test-Driven Development**: Each task includes comprehensive testing requirements
- **Incremental Delivery**: Each completed task delivers working functionality
- **Microservice Architecture**: Independent, scalable services with clear boundaries

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+
- Git

### Local Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd web-scraping-clustering-tool
```

2. **Set up environment**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configurations
```

3. **Start development services**:
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

4. **Run tests**:
```bash
# Run specific service tests
docker run --rm url-input-service python run_tests.py

# Run integration tests (when available)
./scripts/test.sh
```

## Service Development Guidelines

### Creating a New Service

1. **Create service directory**:
```bash
mkdir services/new-service
cd services/new-service
```

2. **Create basic structure**:
```
services/new-service/
├── main.py              # FastAPI application
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── Dockerfile          # Container configuration
├── test_*.py           # Unit tests
└── README.md           # Service documentation
```

3. **Implement FastAPI service**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()
app = FastAPI(title="New Service", version="1.0.0")

@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    return {"status": "healthy", "service": "new-service"}
```

4. **Add to Docker Compose**:
```yaml
new-service:
  build:
    context: ./services/new-service
  ports:
    - "808X:808X"
  networks:
    - scraping_network
```

from main import URLValidator, URLParser, SmartModelChooser

class TestURLValidator:
    def test_valid_urls(self):
        valid_urls = ["https://example.com", "http://test.org"]
        for url in valid_urls:
            assert URLValidator.is_valid_url(url)
    
    def test_invalid_urls(self):
        invalid_urls = ["not-a-url", "ftp://example.com"]
        for url in invalid_urls:
            assert not URLValidator.is_valid_url(url)

class TestSmartModelChooser:
    def test_hardware_detection(self):
        chooser = SmartModelChooser()
        hardware = chooser.detect_hardware()
        assert "cpu" in hardware
        assert "memory" in hardware
        assert "gpu" in hardware
    
    def test_model_recommendation(self):
        chooser = SmartModelChooser()
        recommendation = chooser.recommend_model(
            task_type="reasoning",
            priority="balanced",
            hardware_constraints={"memory": "8GB"}
        )
        assert recommendation["llm_model"] is not None
        assert recommendation["embedding_model"] is not None
        assert len(recommendation["fallback_chain"]) > 0

class TestParallelProcessing:
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_parallel_authentication_workflow(self):
        urls = [
            "https://public-site.com",
            "https://auth-required-site.com"
        ]
        processor = ParallelURLProcessor()
        results = await processor.process_urls(urls)
        
        assert len(results["public_queue"]) == 1
        assert len(results["auth_queue"]) == 1
        assert results["processing_time"] < 300  # 5 minutes max
```

### Code Quality Standards

#### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Include docstrings for all public functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

#### Error Handling
- Use structured logging with correlation IDs
- Implement graceful degradation
- Provide clear error messages
- Don't expose sensitive information in errors

#### Example Error Handling:
```python
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

try:
    result = process_urls(urls)
    logger.info("URLs processed successfully", count=len(result))
    return result
except ValidationError as e:
    logger.error("URL validation failed", error=str(e))
    raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid URL format")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error("Unexpected error", error=str(e))
    raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Internal server error")
```

## Git Workflow

### Commit Message Format
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(url-input): add csv file upload support
fix(scraper): handle authentication timeout
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(analyzer): add unit tests for embedding generation
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/task-name`: Individual task implementation
- `hotfix/issue-name`: Critical bug fixes

### Commit Guidelines
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Include tests with feature commits
- Update documentation when needed
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Service Logs
```bash
# View all service logs
./scripts/logs.sh

# View specific service logs
./scripts/logs.sh url-input-service

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f url-input-service
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check all services
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Check specific service
curl http://localhost:8081/health
```
