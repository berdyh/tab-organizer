## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Tests timing out:**
```bash
# Increase timeout in pytest.ini
# Check service health
docker compose ps
```

**Port conflicts:**
```bash
make clean
docker compose down -v
```

**Out of memory:**
```bash
# Increase Docker memory limit
# Run fewer tests in parallel
```

**Flaky tests:**
```bash
# Run test multiple times
pytest --count=10 test_file.py
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run validation**: `./scripts/validate-test-setup.sh`
2. **Run tests**: `make test-all`
3. **Review coverage**: `make coverage-report`
4. **Start development**: `make dev`
5. **Read documentation**: `docs/TESTING.md`
